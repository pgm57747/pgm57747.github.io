<p>For my project, I wanted to use this page to tell you about myself and what I enjoy most.
<p>I am from Wilmington, Delaware and I am attending college at the University of Georgia. 
I spent the first  14 years of my life living in Maryland. I attended the same school from
kindergarten to eighth grade. After only going to school with the same 35 people for my entire
life, I decided I needed a change. My family moved to Delaware and I began attending an all-girls
Catholic high school. I enjoyed my high school years but when it began time to choose a college,
I decided to go far, far away from home.
<p>I'd like to include some fun facts about myself. In the table below, I've listed some of my
favorite things!
<table border="1" align="center">
<tr><th>My favorite...</th><th></th></tr>
<tr><th>Movie</th><th>Titanic</th></tr>
<tr><th>TV Show</th><th>The Office</th></tr>
<tr><th>Food</th><th>Chicken Tenders</th></tr>
<tr><th>Sport (to watch)</th><th>Football</th></tr>
<tr><th>Sport (to play)</th><th>Lacrosse</th></tr>
<tr><th>Band</th><th>Blink-182 or The Lumineers</th></tr>
<tr><th>Place</th><th>Ireland</th></tr></table>
<p>Speaking of my favorite place...I'd like to talk about the trip I took to Ireland almost
three years ago. It was one of the best weeks of my life. Three of my best friends from high school
and I all signed up for this school trip. We took a bus all over the country, visiting every major
tourist attraction!

height="250" width="250"><img src="ireland3.jpg" alt="Cliffs of Moher" height="250" width="250"><p>
</div>
<p>The only bad thing about the trip was our terrible tour guide. She got us lost
more than once and only talked about her career as an artist. However, it has become sort
of an inside joke amongst my group of friends. If you'd like to see some of her art, click
on the four-leaf clover!

<p>Besides my week in Ireland, the most fun I have ever had has been at Firefly Music Festival in Dover,
Delaware. I am such a huge fan of all types of music. This festival has always been the perfect place
for me to spend time with all of my friends and see my favorite artists. Last year, my favorite performances
were by Mumford & Sons and A$AP Rocky. If you click <a href="https://fireflyfestival.com/lineup">here</a>,
you can see this years and past years lineups!
